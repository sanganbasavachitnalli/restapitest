This REST service is designed in Go to handle a high volume of requests (at least 10K requests/second) with a GET endpoint that processes unique IDs, supports logging, and sends HTTP requests based on specific conditions. Here’s an overview of the key design elements and extensions.

## Core Requirements

1. Endpoint `/api/verve/accept`:
   - Query Parameters:
     - `id` (int, required): Identifies unique requests.
     - `endpoint` (string, optional): Specifies an HTTP endpoint to which the service makes a request.
   - Response: Returns `"ok"` if successful and `"failed"` if any error occurs.

2. Unique Request Tracking:
   - Redis is used to handle distributed deduplication across instances, ensuring each request ID is counted only once. Each ID is stored in Redis with a TTL to limit memory usage.

3. Logging Unique Counts:
   - Kafka streams the count of unique requests received per minute, supporting distributed logging and scalable data handling.

4. Performance:
   - The code uses Go’s concurrency model and synchronizes counters to handle high throughput effectively.

## Extensions

1. Extension 1: HTTP POST instead of GET
   - If an `endpoint` is provided, the service fires a POST request, serializing the unique request count as JSON payload, rather than using a GET request.

2. Extension 2: Deduplication Behind a Load Balancer
   - Redis supports ID deduplication across instances, ensuring that unique request counts remain accurate even with multiple application instances behind a load balancer.

3. Extension 3: Distributed Streaming of Unique Counts
   - Kafka replaces file-based logging, providing a scalable, fault-tolerant approach to real-time logging by streaming the unique ID count every minute.

## Summary

This solution leverages Redis for distributed deduplication and Kafka for high-throughput logging, meeting the requirements of a scalable, distributed system. Go’s concurrency ensures the service efficiently handles 10K requests per second while maintaining accurate tracking and logging of unique requests across instances.
